# AN588 Assignment 2: Titis in the Mist...

Every Saturday morning, at the same time, a primatologist goes and sits in the forest to listen for titi monkey calls, counting the number of calls they hear in a 2 hour window from 5am to 7am. Based on previous knowledge, she believes that the mean number of calls she will hear in that time is exactly 15. Let X represent the appropriate Poisson random variable of the number of calls heard in each monitoring session.

We have some interesting questions about this pseudo-dataset! Why don't you come and learn about tit monkey calls with me!

## Here's a video of titi monkeys and their calls!
